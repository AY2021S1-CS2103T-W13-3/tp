## Project: Homerce
Homerce is an all-in-one application that helps home-based beauty salon owners consolidate their business details - 
such as their schedule, appointments, clients, and services - into a single application. It also keeps track of the business's
revenue and expenses, and supports simple visualization of monthly finances.
The application uses a Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Overview
This portfolio aims to document the contributions that I have made to Homerce. In this project, our team - Homerce,
will enhance a basic CLI Address Book 3 (AB3) and repurpose it to create our application: Homerce.
