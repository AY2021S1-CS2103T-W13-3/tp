- Homerce is an all-in-one application that helps home-based beauty salon owners consolidate their business details - 
such as their appointments, revenue, and expenses - into a single application. 

- Homerce has a Graphical User Interface (GUI), but it is optimised for use with a Command Line Interface (CLI).
